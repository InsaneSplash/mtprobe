## Overview:

**MTProbe** is a tool to make use of small Mikrotik routers out in the field to perform various network tests. In its core, the project is a medium to develop new uses for the Mikrotik Router as a network testing tool. Currently the project is based on the Mikrotik hAP mini hardware which is currently the cheapest router in the market from Mikrotik. There is no reason it cant be used on other Mikrotik devices.

*Notes:* The probe configuration is based on a Mikrotik hAP mini (RB931-2nD) as the platform.
